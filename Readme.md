## **3️⃣ Data Processing using SQL**
### **🛠 3.1 SQL Queries Applied**
1️⃣ Retrieve all successful bookings.  
2️⃣ Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type.  
3️⃣ Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.  
4️⃣ List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides.  
5️⃣ Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues.  
6️⃣ Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.  
7️⃣ Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI.  
8️⃣ Find the average customer rating per vehicle type.  
9️⃣ Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully.  
🔟 List all incomplete rides along with the reason.
